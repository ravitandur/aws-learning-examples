# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/ravitandur/aws-learning-examples

This repository contains multiple AWS learning projects demonstrating various serverless architectures, event-driven patterns, and AWS service integrations using AWS CDK. Currently deployed and operational in AWS account `142649403032`.

## Development Philosophy

> Think carefully and implement the most concise solution that changes as little code as possible.

### USE SUB-AGENTS FOR CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION

#### 1. Always use the file-analyzer sub-agent when asked to read files.
The file-analyzer agent is an expert in extracting and summarizing critical information from files, particularly log files and verbose outputs. It provides concise, actionable summaries that preserve essential information while dramatically reducing context usage.

#### 2. Always use the code-analyzer sub-agent when asked to search code, analyze code, research bugs, or trace logic flow.

The code-analyzer agent is an expert in code analysis, logic tracing, and vulnerability detection. It provides concise, actionable summaries that preserve essential information while dramatically reducing context usage.

#### 3. Always use the test-runner sub-agent to run tests and analyze the test results.

Using the test-runner agent ensures:

- Full test output is captured for debugging
- Main conversation stays clean and focused
- Context usage is optimized
- All issues are properly surfaced
- No approval dialogs interrupt the workflow

### Error Handling

- **Fail fast** for critical configuration (missing text model)
- **Log and continue** for optional features (extraction model)
- **Graceful degradation** when external services unavailable
- **User-friendly messages** through resilience layer

### Testing

- **CRITICAL**: Always use dedicated test-venv for running ALL tests (unit, integration, e2e)
  ```bash
  cd options-strategy-platform
  source test-venv/bin/activate  
  python tests/options_strategies/strategy_flow/unit/test_simple_basket_allocation.py
  ```
- Always use the test-runner agent to execute tests.
- Do not use mock services for anything ever.
- Do not move on to the next test until the current test is complete.
- If the test fails, consider checking if the test is structured correctly before deciding we need to refactor the codebase.
- Tests to be verbose so we can use them for debugging.
- Unit and e2e testing is critical and must be run regularly for basket-level allocation validation.

## Tone and Behavior

- Criticism is welcome. Please tell me when I am wrong or mistaken, or even when you think I might be wrong or mistaken.
- Please tell me if there is a better approach than the one I am taking.
- Please tell me if there is a relevant standard or convention that I appear to be unaware of.
- Be skeptical.
- Be concise.
- Short summaries are OK, but don't give an extended breakdown unless we are working through the details of a plan.
- Do not flatter, and do not give compliments unless I am specifically asking for your judgement.
- Occasional pleasantries are fine.
- Feel free to ask many questions. If you are in doubt of my intent, don't guess. Ask.

## Project Structure & Navigation

### **Module Organization**
```bash
aws-learning-examples/                    # This file - Shared guidance
├── frontend/CLAUDE.md                    # React/TypeScript development standards
├── user-auth-broker-management/CLAUDE.md # Authentication & broker account patterns  
├── options-strategy-platform/CLAUDE.md   # Revolutionary options trading architecture
└── event-bridge-stepfunction-lambda/CLAUDE.md # Learning project basics
```

### **CLAUDE.md Hierarchy Best Practice**
- **Root CLAUDE.md** (this file): Shared configuration, deployment patterns, enterprise standards
- **Module CLAUDE.md**: Module-specific architecture, APIs, unique implementation details
- **Context Loading**: Claude automatically loads both root and module-specific guidance
- **Priority**: Module-specific context takes priority when conflicts arise

### **Standard Project Pattern**
Each project follows this pattern:
- Individual `CLAUDE.md` with project-specific guidance
- CDK stack with Express Workflows (optimized for cost)
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Deployment scripts with AWS profile validation
- Integration with centralized architecture agent

## Development Patterns

### Cost Optimization
- Prefer Express Step Functions over Standard (98% cost savings)
- Use short log retention periods (7 days for learning projects)
- Include high-volume execution alarms to prevent cost surprises

### Security & Deployment
- Mandatory AWS profile validation in deployment scripts
- No hardcoded credentials or account IDs in code
- Environment-specific configuration via CDK context

### Monitoring Standards
- CloudWatch dashboards for all deployments
- SNS topics for alerting (subscribe manually for notifications)
- Pre-built CloudWatch Insights queries for troubleshooting

## Frontend Development Standards

### Layout Patterns
All React pages MUST follow the algo-platform layout pattern for consistency:

```tsx
const PageComponent: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Page Title</h1>
      
      {/* Content sections with space-y-6 spacing */}
      <div className="grid...">...</div>
      <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow">...</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Key Requirements**:
- Root container: `<div className="space-y-6">` (no width constraints)
- Page titles: `text-2xl font-bold` (never text-3xl)
- Section spacing: `space-y-6` between major sections
- Cards: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow`
- Responsive: Layout component handles padding with `p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8`

### Design System Standards
- **Framework**: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **Colors**: Blue primary (`blue-600`) with full dark mode support
- **Typography**: Inter font, consistent text sizing
- **Components**: Rounded corners (`rounded-lg`), shadow effects
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons (Turtle icon for branding)
- **Form inputs**: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-700` with proper borders
- **Interactive elements**: Consistent hover states and focus rings

### Scrollable Dialog Patterns (2025 Standard)
For complex dialogs like StrategyWizardDialog, use this architecture:

```tsx
// REQUIRED PATTERN: Fixed header + scrollable content + sticky footer
const ScrollableDialog: React.FC = () => (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50 backdrop-blur-sm flex items-center justify-center p-2 sm:p-4 z-50">
    <div className="w-full max-w-5xl h-full sm:h-[95vh] flex flex-col">
      <Card className="flex flex-col bg-white/95 dark:bg-gray-900/95 backdrop-blur-md overflow-hidden h-full">
        {/* Fixed Header */}
        <CardHeader className="flex-shrink-0">...</CardHeader>
        
        {/* Scrollable Content */}
        <CardContent className="flex-1 flex flex-col overflow-hidden p-0">
          <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">
            {/* Complex forms, dynamic content */}
          </div>
          
          {/* Sticky Footer */}
          <div className="flex-shrink-0 sticky bottom-0 backdrop-blur-md border-t p-4">
            {/* Action buttons */}
          </div>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

**Key Requirements**:
- Mobile optimization: `h-full sm:h-[95vh]` and `p-2 sm:p-4`
- Proper overflow management: `overflow-y-auto` on content area
- Glassmorphism effects: `backdrop-blur-md` for modern depth
- Sticky footer: Ensures actions always accessible

### Authentication Integration
- JWT tokens with auto-refresh functionality
- Context-based state management for user auth
- Indian market specialization (phone validation, states)
- Secure credential handling for broker APIs
- Enhanced broker account management with OAuth integration
- frontend-amplify module/folder in current root project is only experimental, so going forward don't search or do any analysis in this folder. Don't use this folder for any of the context required.

## ABSOLUTE RULES

- **NO PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION**
- **NO SIMPLIFICATION**: no "//This is simplified stuff for now, complete implementation would blablabla"
- **NO CODE DUPLICATION**: check existing codebase to reuse functions and constants Read files before writing new functions. Use common sense function name to find them easily.
- **NO DEAD CODE**: either use or delete from codebase completely
- **IMPLEMENT TEST FOR EVERY FUNCTIONS**
- **NO CHEATER TESTS**: test must be accurate, reflect real usage and be designed to reveal flaws. No useless tests! Design tests to be verbose so we can use them for debugging.
- **NO INCONSISTENT NAMING** - read existing codebase naming patterns.
- **NO OVER-ENGINEERING** - Don't add unnecessary abstractions, factory patterns, or middleware when simple functions would work. Don't think "enterprise" when you need "working"
- **NO MIXED CONCERNS** - Don't put validation logic inside API handlers, database queries inside UI components, etc. instead of proper separation
- **NO RESOURCE LEAKS** - Don't forget to close database connections, clear timeouts, remove event listeners, or clean up file handles

## Latest Enterprise Standards & CDK Compliance (September 2, 2025)

### ✅ Critical LogGroup Pattern Fix - Enterprise Deployment Reliability
**Major Achievement**: Resolved "LogGroup already exists" errors preventing reliable stack redeployments across all environments

#### **Problem Identified & Root Cause**:
- **Issue**: Explicit LogGroup creation with `log_group` parameter caused deployment failures
- **Error**: "LogGroup already exists" errors on stack redeploy, especially in staging/production environments
- **Root Cause**: CDK doesn't handle LogGroup deletion/recreation reliably with removal policies (DESTROY/RETAIN)
- **Impact**: Prevented reliable CI/CD pipelines and required manual LogGroup cleanup

#### **Enterprise Solution Implemented**:
1. **Reverted to logRetention Pattern**:
   - **Updated CDK Stack Creation Agent** to recommend `logRetention` parameter over explicit LogGroups
   - **Reasoning**: Prevents redeploy errors while maintaining same functionality and enterprise compliance
   - **Trade-off**: Shows deprecation warning but ensures reliable deployments across all environments

2. **Both Stacks Updated**:
   - **User-Auth-Broker Stack**: Removed 9 explicit LogGroup constructs, updated all Lambda functions
   - **Options Strategy Stack**: Removed 16 explicit LogGroup constructs, updated all Lambda functions
   - **Pattern**: Simple `log_retention=logs.RetentionDays.ONE_WEEK` parameter
   - **Result**: `Custom::LogRetention` resources handle LogGroup lifecycle properly

3. **Enterprise Standards Maintained**:
   - **Environment-Specific Retention**: 7 days (dev), 30 days (staging), 90 days (production)
   - **Python 3.11 Runtime**: All Lambda functions continue to use modern runtime
   - **Module-Prefix Naming**: Consistent resource naming patterns maintained
   - **Configuration-Driven**: All values continue from shared environments.json

#### **Deployment Success Metrics**:
- ✅ **Dev Environment**: Clean destroy/redeploy capability verified for both stacks
- ✅ **Staging/Production**: No more manual LogGroup cleanup required
- ✅ **Cross-Stack Integration**: Options stack successfully imports from auth stack
- ✅ **Enterprise Reliability**: Both stacks ready for production CI/CD pipelines

### ✅ CDK Stack Creation Agent Updated
**Location**: `.claude/agents/cdk_stack_creation_agent.md`

**Updated Principles**:
1. **Reliable Deployment Pattern**: Use `logRetention` parameter for Lambda functions
2. **Zero Hardcoded Values**: Company prefixes, project names from configuration
3. **Python 3.11 Runtime**: Standard runtime enforcement across all functions
4. **Module-Prefix Naming**: Consistent patterns for resource identification
5. **Configuration-Driven Design**: Environment-specific values from shared_config/environments.json

**New Validation Checklist**:
- ✅ **logRetention Used**: All Lambda functions use logRetention parameter (not explicit LogGroups)
- ✅ **Python 3.11 Runtime**: All functions use modern runtime
- ✅ **Module Prefix Pattern**: All construct IDs follow consistent naming
- ✅ **Resource Name Pattern**: All resource names follow {module-prefix}-{function-name}
- ✅ **Deployment Reliability**: Stacks can be destroyed and redeployed without errors
