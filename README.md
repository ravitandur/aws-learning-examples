# AWS Learning Examples

A collection of hands-on AWS serverless architecture examples built with AWS CDK, demonstrating event-driven patterns, cost-optimized deployments, and comprehensive monitoring.

## Projects

### ðŸš€ EventBridge-StepFunction-Lambda
**Status**: âœ… Complete  
**Architecture**: EventBridge â†’ Express Step Functions â†’ Lambda  
**Features**: IST timezone handling, 2-minute scheduling, comprehensive monitoring  
**Cost**: ~$45/month for 100K executions (Express Workflows optimization)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js + AWS CDK (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)
- AWS profile `account2` configured for deployments

### Quick Start
1. Clone repository
2. Navigate to desired project directory
3. Run deployment: `./deploy.sh -p account2`
4. Monitor via CloudWatch Dashboard

## Architecture Patterns

- **Express Step Functions** for cost optimization (98% savings vs Standard)
- **Event-driven workflows** with EventBridge integration
- **Timezone-aware scheduling** (IST display, UTC processing)
- **Comprehensive monitoring** with dashboards and alerting
- **Profile-validated deployments** for security

## Monitoring & Operations

Each project includes:
- CloudWatch Dashboard with key metrics
- SNS alerting for failures and high-volume scenarios
- CloudWatch Insights queries for troubleshooting
- Cost protection alarms

## Development Philosophy

- **Learning-focused**: Real-world patterns with educational value
- **Cost-conscious**: Optimized for learning without surprise bills
- **Production-ready**: Includes monitoring, error handling, and security
- **Reusable**: Standardized patterns across projects
