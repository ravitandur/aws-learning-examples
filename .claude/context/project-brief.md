# Project Brief

## Project Mission

**Build a revolutionary algorithmic options trading platform that achieves institutional-grade precision at retail-friendly costs, specifically optimized for the Indian market.**

## What This Project Does

### Core Functionality
The AWS Learning Examples project has evolved into a comprehensive multi-stack platform that enables:

1. **Automated Options Strategy Execution**: Precise timing and multi-broker support for complex options strategies
2. **User Authentication & Broker Management**: Secure OAuth integration with multiple Indian brokers  
3. **Revolutionary Performance**: 0-second precision timing and 99.5% query optimization
4. **Enterprise Reliability**: Comprehensive testing, monitoring, and weekend protection
5. **Educational Value**: Real-world AWS patterns with production-ready implementations

### Technical Achievement
- **Timing Precision**: Solved EventBridge delays to achieve 0-second boundary execution
- **Database Optimization**: Reduced 401+ queries to 2 queries via innovative GSI2 design
- **Multi-Stack Architecture**: Clean separation between authentication and trading concerns
- **AWS Best Practices**: CDK deployment patterns with enterprise reliability
